                    <h2>We are interesting in talking to you!</h2>
                    <br><br>We are currently recruiting MSc and/or PhD students for the 2025 cohorts. Both spring/winter 2025 and fall 2025 start dates are possible.
                     <!-- <p><h2>Projects will focus on</h2> understanding the biological solution(s) to the stability/plasticity dilemma. In dynamic environments, our brains have a remarkable capacity to balance the plasticity needed for continual learning against the stability needed to reliably maintain beliefs or policies over time. We want to understand how this happens. -->
                    <!-- <p><h2>Our approach</h2> combines (1) large-scale neural recordings/causal manipulations in non-human primates, (2) human psychophysics, and (3) computational models of neural data and behavior. We welcome candidates who are interested in any or all of these techniques. -->
                    <p><h2>The lab is located</h2> in the Department of Neuroscience at the University of Montr&eacute;al (UdeM). The department is highly collaborative, <a href="join.html">Montr&eacute;al is a great place to live</a>, and UdeM has some unique bridges between neuroscience, <a href="https://www.unique.quebec/">AI research</a>, <a href="https://ivado.ca/en/">data science</a>, and the <a href="http://circa.umontreal.ca/">learning sciences</a>.
                    <p><h2>We expect</h2> successful candidates to undertake a research project that involves some combination of (1) behavioral experiments in humans, (2) large-scale electrophysiology studies in the rhesus macaque, and/or (3) computational modeling. We welcome candidates who are interested in any or all of these techniques. All positions will involve collecting data, analyzing data, writing for fellowships and travel awards, and disseminating research in talks, posters, and publications. The ideal candidates will be excited to take the lead on their own project, coordinating with others for support as needed. All students in the lab are expected to participate in other professional development activities related to their long-term career goals, whatever those may be.
                    <p><h2>We are looking for</h2> people who bring something interesting to the table. We know that working in a diverse and inclusive lab makes us better scientists and happier people, and we encourage applications from people from all backgrounds and with all identities. There are some skills and experiences that would help you hit the ground running, so you should definitely reach out if you have a few of the following qualifications and are motivated to develop the others:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Programming experience (ideally Matlab, Python, or Julia).</li>
                        <li>Experience in collecting and/or analyzing neurophysiology data.</li>
                        <li>Experience working with non-human primates or other kinds of animals.</li>
                        <li>A solid quantitative background, especially in dynamical systems theory, control theory, and/or linear algebra.</li>
                        <li>Excellent written and oral communication skills in English.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><h2>If you would like to apply,</h2> please send your CV to <a href="mailto:becket@ebitzlab.com">becket@ebitzlab.com</a>. In your email, please describe 1) why you are interested in the position, and 2) your background, including any previous research you have done.
