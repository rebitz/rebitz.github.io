<!--                    <br><br>The noiseLab is looking for student interns. We have multiple opportunities available to work on fundamental questions like <em>why do we make mistakes?</em>, <em>how do we forget things?</em>, and <em>what's the best way to make decisions?</em> We have funding from NSERC to support students over the summer. Previous students have been able to complete their own projects&mdash;even write up their own papers&mdash;during their time in the lab.-->
<!--                    <p><h2>How can I get involved?</h2> Let's talk about your interests and skills! Maybe you want to learn how to analyze neural recordings? Get really good at Python and/or Matlab? Learn how to monitor and interpret physiological signals? Become a master animal-trainer? Use a supercomputer to fit computational models or find optimal solutions to thorny problems? Let's find a project that you're excited about.-->
<!--                    -->
<!--                    <p>Working in a diverse and inclusive lab makes us better scientists and happier people. We strongly encourage applications from people from all backgrounds and with all identities.-->

<!--                    <p><h2>Who is the noiseLab?</h2> We are a new lab in the Department of Neurosciences, established in fall 2020  by <a href="https://twitter.com/BecketEbs">PI Becket Ebitz<a>. We are located on campus, at the Pavillon Paul-G-Desmarais. The lab studies how our internal goals, beliefs, and states change how we interact with the world. We use a combination of methods, including neural recordings, behavioral experiments, and computational models.-->
