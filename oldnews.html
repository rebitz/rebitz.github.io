                        <p> <h1>Old News:</h1></p>
                        <p> <h2>3/11/16:</h2> Thanks to Asif Ghazanfar and the <a href="http://asifg.mycpanel.princeton.edu/index.php">Ghazanfar lab</a> for inviting me to talk about our dACC recordings and the relationship between autonomic arousal, vigilance, and decision-making. It was both a good time and fruitful.
                        <p> <h2>3/05/16:</h2> Had a great time (as always) at <a href="http://www.cosyne.org/">Cosyne</a>. I got to give a talk about our FEF recordings at the main meeting. You can check out the slides <a href="EbitzCosyne2016.pdf" onClick="ga('send', 'event', { eventCategory: 'download', eventAction: 'cosyneSlides'});">here</a>.
                        <p> <h2>10/22/15:</h2> Back from SfN! I gave a poster on our FEF microstimulation results. It turns out FEF microstimulation can modulate the gain of a brainstem sensorimotor reflex. This kind of motif - top-down regulation of lower-level circuitry - might be a powerful way for the prefrontal cortex to exert control. You can check out the poster <a href="EbitzMoore_sfn2015.pdf" onClick="ga('send', 'event', { eventCategory: 'download', eventAction: 'PLRposter'});">here</a>.
                        <p> <h2>10/7/15:</h2> Just gave a talk in <a href="http://brodylab.org/">Carlos Brody's lab</a>. Thanks for the great discussion and really thoughtful and interesting feedback!
                        <p> <h2>7/14/15:</h2> Thanks to Jon Cohen and the rest of the <a href="https://ncclab.princeton.edu/">Cohen lab</a> for the opportunity to talk about my FEF recording work!</p>
                        <p> <h2>5/19/15:</h2> Just gave my last Math, Monkeys, Machines seminar talk - on my FEF microstimulation project. It was a great conclusion to my time at Stanford. Thanks to everyone who came out!
                        <p> <h2>5/15/15:</h2> I've been awarded the <a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/opportunities/cv-starr-fellow-opportunities">CV Starr Fellowship</a> from the <a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/">Princeton Neuroscience Institute</a>. So - I'm off to New Jersey to work on some exciting new problems with some exciting new people!
                        <p> <h2>3/10/15:</h2> Thanks to the <a href="http://gru.stanford.edu/">Gardner lab</a> in the Psychology department at Stanford for inviting me to give a talk about what I've learned about pupil size in my various projects. It was fun to pull that stuff together in a new way and I got a lot out of the discussion!
                        <p> <h2>2/4/15:</h2> Our paper on the relationship between conflict, error, and arousal signals in dACC is out today in <i>Neuron</i>. You can check out a pdf <a href="EbitzPlatt_dACCconflictPupil.pdf" onClick="ga('send', 'event', { eventCategory: 'download', eventAction: 'dACCpaper'});"  target="_blank">here</a>.
                        <p> <h2>1/9/15:</h2> Just gave my FEF network states talk at the Math, Monkeys, Machines seminar series. Thanks for the great feedback and newfound collaborators in the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/">Boahen lab</a>!
                        <p> <h2>12/15/14:</h2> Just presented a talk entitled "Frontal eye field target selectivity is blunted during exploratory choice" at the <a href="http://stanford.edu/~melinau/Site/Service.html">Memory, Attention, and Decision-Making</a> seminar series at Stanford.
                        <p> <h2>11/20/14:</h2> Thanks to <a href="http://bromberg-martin.com/">Ethan Bromberg-Martin</a> and the other neuroscience folks at Columbia University for the opportunity to give my "Exploration, distraction, and saccadic selection" talk and to hear more about your work!
                        <p> <h2>11/19/14:</h2> I just presented a poster entitled "Target selectivity in the frontal eye field (FEF) is blunted during exploratory choice" at the Society for Neuroscience conference in Washington, DC. Ran out of mini-posters, but you can check out a pdf of the poster <a href="EbitzSfn2014.pdf">here</a>.
                        <p> <h2>11/13/14:</h2> Thanks to the <a href="http://haydenlab.com/">Hayden Lab</a> and the <a href="http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/">Brain and Cognitive Sciences</a> department at the University of Rochester for inviting me to give a talk on my graduate and postdoctoral work, entitled "Exploration, distraction, and saccadic selection in rhesus macaques."
