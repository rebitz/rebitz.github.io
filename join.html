                        <h1>We are hiring!</h1>
                        <p><h2>Montr&eacute;al</h2> is one of the most unique and vibrant cities in North America. The city is deeply multicultural and home to world class restaurants, museums, festivals, and culture. Even people you don't know will want to visit you here. Montr&eacute;al is also quite affordable. Including rent, cost of living in Montreal is 20-50&percnt; lower than comparable North American cities (i.e. Toronto, Vancouver, NYC, Boston, Chicago), so you can afford to both live here and enjoy living here.</p>
                        <p>The university is francophone, <strong>but you do not have to be fluent in french to join the lab</strong>. Some French will help you get the most out of the city and out of UdeM, but you may be a good fit for us even if your french is a bit rusty or slightly nonexistant.</p>
                        <p><h2>How can I join?</h2></p>
                        <p>UdeM offers both a <strong>MSc and PhD</strong> in Neuroscience. If you already have a masters or a few years of previous lab experience, you may be a good candidate for the PhD program. If not, then consider a masters degree. (If things go well, you will be welcome to stay on for your PhD afterwards.) If you're interested in applying, email <a href="mailto:rebitz@gmail.com">Becket</a> with a copy of your CV and a few paragraphs explaining (1) why you're interested in the lab and (2) why you are a good fit so that we can talk about what program you should apply to.</p>
                        <p>If you're interested in doing a <strong>postdoc</strong> in the lab, please send <a href="mailto:rebitz@gmail.com">Becket</a> a brief statement of interest and a copy of your CV. I will probably ask for a representative writing sample (i.e. a paper, preprint, or thesis chapter) and some references (both peers and mentors).</p>
                        <p><h2>Who is a good fit for the lab?</h2></p>
                        <p>The kind of research we do requires a lot of teamwork, and we love working with passionate, creative people who are generous with their time and expertise. There are also a few practical skills that would make you stand out as an applicant, though these are not strictly required.</p>
                        <p>First, our ideal candidates have worked with animals. This could mean volunteering at an animal shelter, growing up on a farm, or working in a lab. For graduate applicants, experience in any kind of lab is a plus, especially if you had an independent project.</p>
                        <p>Second, our ideal candidates know some math and have done some programming. Maybe you were a CS or math major or maybe you have done lot of self-study on Coursera or MIT OpenCourseware. Highlight this!</p>
                        <p>There are a lot of other ways that you could be the perfect fit for the lab, so don't hesitate to start a conversation if you're interested in what we do. Ultimately, our ideal candidates are going to be people who are different from each other, rather than people who all have the same background. If working in a diverse and inclusive laboratory community sounds pretty good to you, come help us build one.</p>
                        <p><h2>How can I be successful in the lab?</h2></p>
                        Pretty much, (1) be kind and be friendly, (2) ask for help early and often, (3) find a problem that keeps you up at night, (4) go to sleep anyway.
                        </p>
