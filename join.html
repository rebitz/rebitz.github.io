                        <h1>We are hiring!</h1>
                        <p><h2>Montr&eacute;al</h2> is one of the most unique and interesting cities in North America. It is deeply multicultural and home to world class restaurants, museums, festivals, and probably also whatever other kinds of culture you are into. Even people you don't know will want to visit you here. Montr&eacute;al is also affordable. Including rent, cost of living in Montreal is 20-50&percnt; lower than other North American cities (i.e. it's cheaper than Toronto, Vancouver, NYC, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, and even Minneapolis), so you can afford to actually enjoy living here.</p>
                        <p>The university is francophone, <strong>but you do not have to be fluent in French to join the lab</strong>. Some French will help you get the most out of the city and out of UdeM, but you may be a good fit for us even if your french is a bit rusty or nonexistant.</p>
                        <p><h2>How can I join?</h2></p>
                        <p>If you're interested in joining the lab, just email <a href="mailto:rebitz@gmail.com">Becket</a>,  with a copy of your CV and a few paragraphs explaining (1) why you're interested in the lab and (2) what your background is. If you're an undergraduate, we can talk about what graduate programs you could apply to. If you're a graduate student, we can talk about what kinds of problems you could work on.</p>
                        <p><h2>Who is a good fit for the lab?</h2></p>
                        <p>The kind of research we do requires a lot of teamwork, and we love working with people who are generous with their time, expertise, and creativity. There are also a few practical skills that would make you stand out as an applicant, but these are not strictly required.</p>
                        <p>For one, our ideal candidates have worked with animals. This could mean volunteering at an animal shelter, growing up on a farm, or working in a lab. Any experience is a plus!</p>
                        <p>Second, our ideal candidates know some math and have done some programming. Maybe you were a CS or math major or maybe you have done lot of self-study on Coursera or MIT OpenCourseware. Highlight this!</p>
                        <p>There are a lot of ways that you could be the perfect fit for the lab, so don't hesitate to start a conversation if you're interested in what we do. Ultimately, our ideal candidates are people who are different from each other, rather than people who all have the same background. If working in a diverse and inclusive laboratory community sounds pretty good to you, come help us build one.</p>
                        <p><h2>How can I be successful in the lab?</h2></p>
                        Pretty much, (1) be kind and be friendly, (2) ask for help, (3) find a problem that keeps you up at night, (4) go to sleep anyway.
                        </p>
