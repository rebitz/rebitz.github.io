                        <p><h2>Montr&eacute;al</h2> is one of the most unique cities in North America. It is deeply multicultural and home to world class restaurants, museums, festivals, and probably also whatever other kind of culture you are into. Even people you don't know will want to visit you here.</p>
                        <p>Montr&eacute;al is also affordable. Including rent, cost of living is 20-50&percnt; lower here than in other major North American cities (i.e. it's cheaper than Toronto, Vancouver, NYC, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, and Minneapolis).</p>
                        <p>The university is francophone, <strong>but you do not have to be fluent in French to join the lab</strong>. Some French will help you get the most out of the city and out of UdeM, but you may be a good fit for us even if your french is a bit rusty or nonexistant.</p>
                        <p><h2>How can I join?</h2></p>
                        <p>If you're interested in joining the lab, you can email <a href="mailto:rebitz@gmail.com">Becket</a>,  with a copy of your CV and a few paragraphs explaining (1) why you're interested in the lab and (2) what your background is. We are almost always accepting applications, but if we have a specific search going on, you can learn more about that <a href="jobAd.html">here</a>.</p>
                        <p><h2>Who is a good fit for the lab?</h2></p>
                        <p>The kind of research we do requires a lot of teamwork, so we love working with people who are generous with their time, expertise, and creativity. If you have experience working with animals, love math, or have done a lot of programming, you should probably highlight that in your cover letter. We are always looking for people with those skills.</p>
                        <p>Beyond that, there are a lot of ways that you could be the perfect fit for the lab, so don't hesitate to start a conversation if you're interested in what we do. Ultimately, our ideal candidates are people who are different from each other, rather than people who all have the same background. If working in a diverse and inclusive laboratory community sounds pretty good to you, come help us build one.</p>
                        <p><h2>How can I be successful in the lab?</h2></p>
                        Pretty much, (1) be kind and be friendly, (2) ask for help, (3) find a problem that keeps you up at night, (4) go to sleep anyway.
